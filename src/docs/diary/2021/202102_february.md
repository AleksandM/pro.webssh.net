Hi everybody :wave:

WebSSH 14.10 - Truck :truck: will be released soon with six bug fixes and two additions.

Since January I'm now a CTO junior, and I have a lot of work... :cold_sweat:

In the mean time WebSSH 14.11 - :milky_way: is on it's way!

And do you know what will be the major feature of this release?

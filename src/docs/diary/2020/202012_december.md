# December
:christmas_tree: Xmas is coming soon and (at this time of writing, December 15) no [14.8](/documentation/changelog/14.8) release available, WTF:interrobang:

I'm working hard to replace [UIWebView engine by WKWebView](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=edwud51q) instead. It works fine but I need more [beta testers](/documentation/becoming-external-tester/) to ensure that no glitches are in.

Moreover between 23 to 27 December, App Store will be [closed](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=83m4plrb), so I won't release 14.8 before December 27 :innocent:

WebSSH [Privacy Policy](/documentation/legal/privacy-policy/) have been updated to reflect [Apple requirements](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=3wann9gh). Short and long summary : I don't collect any data :raised_hand:

If I don't see you soon, have a nice Xmas with your family and friends :santa: :christmas_tree: :gift:

!!! info "Erratum"
    I'm releasing WebSSH 14.8 - Locomotive today December 28, 2020 :muscle:

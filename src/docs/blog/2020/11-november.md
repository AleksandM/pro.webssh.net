# November 2020
This month I have released two versions of WebSSH : [14.6 - Bicyclist :bicyclist:](/documentation/changelog/14.6/) (9 issues) and [14.7 - Tractor :tractor:](/documentation/changelog/14.7/) (4 issues).

We have also written a [Competitors](/documentation/competitors) page in order to list all missing features that you would like to have inside WebSSH.

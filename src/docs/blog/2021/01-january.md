# January 2021

Happy new year to everyone :confetti_ball:

WebSSH 14.9 - Helicopter :helicopter: has been released on January 3 with two bug fixes and two enhancements :

* Files App Support : a file container is now linked to WebSSH
* Uploading files through SFTP : you can now upload your files from your iDevice by using the Files App

It's not a big release but enough to enjoy me :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

See you :wave: next month

Is spring over? :sunflower:

Anyway we have release WebSSH 14.17 - Mushroom :mushroom: in order to introduce a "little" [pricing](/documentation/pricing/) change : WebSSH is now available in three versions : FREE / STARTER / PRO

If you have already bought our "Unlimited" In App Purchase, it's the same as the rebranded "PRO" one. So no worry at all.

Otherwise you can now buy WebSSH depending on your budget and the features you care about.

Don't forget to enroll to our [beta testing program](/documentation/becoming-external-tester/), over 300+ testers are already here :two_men_holding_hands: :couple: :two_women_holding_hands:

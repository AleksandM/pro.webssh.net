# July 2021

I'm switching back :arrows_counterclockwise:

Only one purchase is now available : [PRO](/documentation/pricing/)

Why this change:question:

Because I've heard you and everybody want just a simple In App Purchase item :innocent:

You've already bought the STARTER one? Don't worry! It will be upgraded to PRO, for free.

WebSSH 15.0 - Cactus :cactus: will be released in a few days. It's not a "big big big" release but it's now time to step up the release number as WebSSH 14.0 has been shipped twelve months ago :star2:

What about the Programming Languages powering WebSSH:question:

| Language | LOC | % |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Objective-C | 186 056 | 85% |
| JavaScript | 24 078 | 11% |
| HTML | 4 377 | 2% |
| Objective-C++ | 2 189 | 1% |
| Swift | 2 190 | 1% |
| *Total* | *218 890* | *100%* |

The main objective in the upcoming years : the use of Swift should be over 50% :sweat_smile:

See you folks :wave:

# About WebSSH
WebSSH is an "awesome" iOS / iPadOS / macOS SSH, SFTP and Port Forwarding client available in the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/webssh-ssh-client/id497714887) since 2012!

## What about the name?
As everybody knows, the "SSH" part means Secure Shell. But what about the "Web" part?

Just because WebSSH terminal rendering engine is based on [hterm](https://github.com/chromium/hterm), a JS library :)

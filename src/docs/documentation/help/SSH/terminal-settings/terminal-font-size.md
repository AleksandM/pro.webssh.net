title: Terminal Font Size
---

* When you set the Terminal Font Size you do it on the current device form factor.
* If you own an iPad, an iPhone and a MacBook : you will be only able to set the font size on each device and not from the others.
* If you own multiple device form factors (two MacBook for example) : the font size will be synced if you have enabled iCloud

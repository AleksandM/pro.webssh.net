# iCloud
WebSSH supports iCloud and will sync your database across your devices. So when you add a connection on one of your device, this connection will be synced to your other devices seemlessly.

## Enabling syncing
By default your data are not synced with iCloud. To enable it, follow these steps :

1. Launch WebSSH
2. Go to Settings :gear:
3. Go to iCloud[^1]
4. Check "Enable iCloud"

[^1]: In order to use this functionality, you must upgrade WebSSH to 14.15

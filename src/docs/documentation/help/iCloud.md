# iCloud
WebSSH 14.15 and above supports iCloud sync across your devices. When you add a connection on one of your device, this connection will be synced to your other devices seemlessly.

## Enabling syncing
By default your data are not synced with iCloud. To enable it, follow these steps :

1. Launch WebSSH
2. Go to Settings :gear:
3. Go to iCloud
4. Check "Enable iCloud"

## Syncing credentials
Due to security by default and by design, WebSSH won't sync your credentials (passwords, keys, port knocking sequences) by default.
Only the password used to lock WebSSH (if any) will be synced by default.

To sync all your credentials across your devices, follow these steps :

1. Launch WebSSH
2. Go to Settings :gear:
3. Go to iCloud
4. Check "Sync credentials"

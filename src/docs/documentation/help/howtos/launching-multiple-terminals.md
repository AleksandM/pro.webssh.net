# How to launch multiple SSH or SFTP connections?

!!! info "Split View / Slide Over"
    WebSSH isn't - yet - compatible with Split View / Slide Over :sob:

    But I have a temporary solution for you...

1. Launch WebSSH
2. Go to Settings :gear:
3. Go to WebSSH Settings
4. Enable "Allow multiple features at the same time"

You will now be able to switch or add new windows by pressing the navigation bar. 

It's hacky but it works while I'm working on Split View / Slide Over :construction_worker:

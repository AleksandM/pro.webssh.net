# Link Connections and Snippets

!!! info "About WebSSH Tags"
    * WebSSH Tags are one-word labels that can be used to link connections and snippets.
    * When a snippet is linked to a connection it can be shown as a favorite for the given connection(s).

## How to link a connection and a snippet?
A connection and a snippet are "linked" when they share one or more tags. So if you add a tag to a snippet, the same tag should be applied to a connection in order to link them and so to be able to use the snippet with your connection.

## How to add multiple tags?
You can use any of these separators in order to add multiple tags : `,;/-|` and `space`

!!! tip "Tips"
    * You can mix multiple separators on the same line, it doesn't matter.
    * Tags are always capitalized. It's "not possible" to add a lower case tag (or should be reported as bug).
    * By default a blank tag is applied so all snippets are linked to all connections.
    * You can add as many tags you want to a connection or a snippet.
    * You can use the wildcard `*` to link a snippet to all connections.

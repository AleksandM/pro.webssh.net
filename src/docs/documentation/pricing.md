!!! info "More information"
    * The maximum number of connections is per each type : SSH / SFTP / Tunnel. So STARTER version can be used with 10 SSH + 10 SFTP + 10 Tunnels.
    * On PRO version, unlimited really mean not limited at all : you can add as many connections as you want :exclamation:
    * When you buy our "STARTER" or "PRO" version, you buy them for **lifetime**. No hidden fees. See for yourself.

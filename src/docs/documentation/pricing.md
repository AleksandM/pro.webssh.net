    A fix will be shipped on June 8 2021. If you can't wait until that date, please redeem a **free unlock code** by writing us : team@webssh.net

* The maximum number of connections is per each type : SSH / SFTP / Tunnel. So STARTER version can be used with 10 SSH + 10 SFTP + 10 Tunnels.
* On PRO version, unlimited really mean not limited at all : you can add as many connections as you want :exclamation:
* When you buy our "STARTER" or "PRO" version, you buy them for **lifetime**.

# June 2022

How are you folks?

After two months of "hard" work I'm proud to release WebSSH 18 :tada:

In the following months I will try to maintain a "screenshot blog" on [buymeacoffee.com](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/isontheline/posts). What do you think about?

I would like to make amazing stuff on the Apple Watch...
Any [help is welcome](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/isontheline) in order to acquire a Watch üôè

Have a nice day :sunny:

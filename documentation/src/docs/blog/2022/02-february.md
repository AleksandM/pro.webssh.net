# February 2022

WebSSH 17 - Shell :shell: is coming in a few days :tada:

The "only" feature shipped with 17.0 is the new rendering engine : Xterm.js is now used instead of Hterm

Other features will be implemented on 17.X releases in a few days and weeks.

On March 8th 2022, WebSSH will celebrate its 10th anniversary :gift:

See you :wave:

## About WebSSH
WebSSH is an "awesome" iOS / macOS SSH, SFTP and Port Forwarding client since 2012!

## Installation
1. Launch the App Store on your iOS or macOS device
2. Search for "WebSSH - SysAdmin Tools"
3. Install it, it's [freemium](/documentation/pricing/)!

Alternately if you don't find it, use this link to the App Store : [download WebSSH](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/webssh-ssh-client/id497714887)

!!! info "Beta Releases"
    Want to try the upcoming releases?

    [Enroll to Beta Releases](/documentation/becoming-external-tester/) and reach the stars :sparkles:

## What about the name?
As everybody knows, the "SSH" part means Secure Shell. But what about the "Web" part?

Just because WebSSH terminal rendering engine is based on [Xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/), a JS library :)

Have a nice day :sunny:

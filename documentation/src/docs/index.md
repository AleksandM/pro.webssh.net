## About WebSSH

## Privacy Policy
WebSSH has been created with Privacy and Security in mind. We don't collect any data at all, period!

Latest version (2024-01-06) of our Privacy Policy is available [here](/documentation/legal/privacy-policy/).

## What about the name?
The name sounds weird? Think twice! WebSSH is a NATIVE and LOCAL SysAdmin Toolbox with Privacy and Security in mind which ensure that no data will leave your device outside your own secure servers.

As everybody knows, the "SSH" part means Secure Shell. But what about the "Web" part?

Just because WebSSH terminal rendering engine is based on [Xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/), a JS library running on your own device! :)

Have a nice day :sunny:

# Apple Magic Keyboard Space Bar Issue
Some users reported an issue with the space bar and WebSSH terminal.

This error may happen only on Apple Magic Keyboard when you press the space bar and only when you are using the terminal part of WebSSH.

If you can't use your space bar on your Apple Magic Keyboard, please try to use the following tip :

* Go to iOS Settings
* Go to Accessibility
* Go to Keyboard
* Disable "Full Keyboard Access"

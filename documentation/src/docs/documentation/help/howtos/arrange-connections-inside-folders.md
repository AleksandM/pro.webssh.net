title: Arrange connections inside folders (groups and subgroups)
---

Since WebSSH 28.0 you can now arrange your connections inside subgroups!

# How to create groups and subgroups?
Just create regular group name and put any of the following magic chars between each part of subgroups : `/;,>:|`

You can use any magic chars to make your subgroups, no matter you have already used another.

## Examples
1. Cloud / AWS / Production
2. Cloud | GCP | Production
3. Cloud > OVHcloud > Staging
4. Cloud / Azure ; Staging

title: Arrow Keys Modes
---

Some of WebSSH' users are encountering troubles when using arrow keys :
> * I can't use WebSSH on HP switches, Aruba wireless access points and fortigate firewalls...
> * Arrow keys aren't working properly inside WebSSH!

You can try to change the "Cursor Keys Mode" on your favorite connections :

1. Edit your connection (long pressing on iOS / iPadOS, right click on macOS)
2. Choose the latest option "Terminal Settings"
3. Switch "Cursor Keys Mode" to "Normal"

Does't work? Please [contact me](/support/).

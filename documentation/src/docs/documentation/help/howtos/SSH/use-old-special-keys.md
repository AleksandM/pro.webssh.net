# How to use "Old Special Keys"?

!!! danger "This feature has been removed in WebSSH 23"
    You can't use the old keys anymore. Sorry :cry:

    But! You can now [customise the keyboard accessory view](/documentation/help/howtos/SSH/customise-keyboard-accessory-view-layout/) to add your own keys layout :grin:

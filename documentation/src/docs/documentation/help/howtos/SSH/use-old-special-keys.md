# How to use "Old Special Keys"?

!!! danger "This feature has been removed in WebSSH 23"
    You can't use the old keys anymore. Sorry :cry:

    But! You can now [customise the keyboard accessory view](/documentation/help/howtos/SSH/customise-keyboard-accessory-view-layout/) to add your own keys layout :grin:

So you are an addict of old WebSSH keys used in the past? :scream_cat:

No problem :bangbang:

1. Launch WebSSH
2. Go to Settings :gear:
3. Go to SSH Settings
4. Enable "Use Old Special Keys"

You will now be able to use the old WebSSH keys :grin:

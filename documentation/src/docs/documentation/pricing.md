!!! abstract "Why upgrading to PRO?"
    :two_hearts: Help me continue WebSSH development by upgrading to **PRO** version : I'm an indie developer who want to make an awesome tool for you!

    :thumbsup: I spend a few hours each day to enhance WebSSH as your feedbacks are coming. I'm always listening to your needs and I'm trying to implement them as soon as possible.

    :arrow_right: By purchasing WebSSH **PRO** you can add as many SSH / SFTP / TUNNEL connections as you want.

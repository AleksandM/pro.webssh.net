## FREE vs PRO
!!! abstract "Why upgrading to PRO?"
    :two_hearts: Help me continue WebSSH development by upgrading to **PRO** version : I'm an indie developer who want to make an awesome tool for you!

    :thumbsup: I spend a few hours each day to enhance WebSSH as your feedbacks are coming. I'm always listening to your needs and I'm trying to implement them as soon as possible.

    :arrow_right: By purchasing WebSSH **PRO** you can add as many SSH / SFTP / TUNNEL connections as you want.

    :one: Only one purchase will allow you to use WebSSH **PRO** on all your devices (by using the same Apple ID). So you will be able to use WebSSH **PRO** on your iPhone, your iPad and your Mac with the same purchase!

    :moneybag: Get your money's worth : Unlike competitors, WebSSH **PRO** isn't a subscription model app. No hidden costs. You buy it for **lifetime** with regular updates for **FREE**!

??? abstract "How to find which version of WebSSH I'm using?"
    Just take a look at the WebSSH app name on your device :
    
     * If it's "WebSSH" then you are using the main version of WebSSH. 
     * If it's "eWebSSH" then you are using the Essential version of WebSSH. 
     * If it's "WebSSH::o" then you are using the Original version of WebSSH.

     You can't choose the wrong version as the App Store will only show you the version that is available in your country.

[^1]: eWebSSH is the "Essential" version of WebSSH. It is mainly distributed in countries with security or law restrictions.
[^2]: WebSSH::o is the "Original" version of WebSSH. It only contains the main and original features of WebSSH.

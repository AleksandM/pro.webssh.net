## FREE vs PRO
??? abstract "Why upgrading to PRO?"
    :two_hearts: Help me continue WebSSH development by upgrading to **PRO** version : I'm an indie developer who want to make an awesome tool for you!

    :thumbsup: I spend a few hours each day to enhance WebSSH as your feedbacks are coming. I'm always listening to your needs and I'm trying to implement them as soon as possible.

    :arrow_right: By purchasing WebSSH **PRO** you can add as many SSH / SFTP / TUNNEL connections as you want.

    :one: Only one purchase will allow you to use WebSSH **PRO** on all your devices (by using the same Apple ID). So you will be able to use WebSSH **PRO** on your iPhone, your iPad and your Mac with the same purchase!

    :moneybag: Get your money's worth : Unlike competitors, WebSSH **PRO** isn't a subscription model app. No hidden costs. You buy it for **lifetime** with regular updates for **FREE**!

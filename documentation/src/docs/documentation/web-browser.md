# Web Browser
Since WebSSH 23.8 you can now use an embedded Web Browser[^1] to access your websites.

The main goal is to be able to access your websites seemlessly through a secure SSH tunnel (aka [Dynamic Port Forwarding](/documentation/help/networking/dynamic-port-forwarding/)) like you would do with a SOCKS proxy.

This feature is still in progress and will be enhanced in the future. All [feedbacks](/support/) are welcome!

[^1]: Web Browser is NOT available on eWebSSH and WebSSH::o versions.

# Sponsors
Hello :wave: I'm [isontheline](https://github.com/sponsors/isontheline) maintainer of WebSSH, the awesome iOS / macOS SSH, SFTP and Port Forwarding client that you use everyday!

As WebSSH **PRO** is a **lifetime** purchase, help me to continue WebSSH development by [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/isontheline), by becoming my [patron](https://en.liberapay.com/isontheline/) :construction_worker: or [buying coffees](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/isontheline) :coffee:

I spend extra hours each day (I have a daytime job) to enhance WebSSH to meet all your expectations, and I like that! 

I love your feedback and your support üëç

Thank you so much for supporting my work ‚ú®

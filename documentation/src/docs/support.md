??? tip "Unable to connect to your server using latest WebSSH release?"
    * WebSSH has now deprecated weak algorithms in order to increase security between your device and your server.
    * It may result in connection issues if your server need to use one of these deprecated algorithms.
    * You can learn more about [Supported Algorithms](/documentation/help/SSH/supported-algorithms/) and [Terrapin Attack](/documentation/help/SSH/terrapin-attack/) to understand the changes made in WebSSH.
    * Regularly make an audit of your SSH clients and servers : [ssh-audit.com](https://www.ssh-audit.com)
    
    If you want to enable again the deprecated algorithms, you can do it by using [this guide](/documentation/help/SSH/terrapin-attack/#enable-all-algorithms).

??? example "Don't miss WebSSH Brain"

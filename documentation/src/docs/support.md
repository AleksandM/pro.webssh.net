    ** [#202 : Unified server list for SSH and SFTP](https://github.com/isontheline/pro.webssh.net/issues/202) **
    
    SSH and SFTP connections are now unified in the same "SERVERS" list. This means that you can now add a new server and use it for both SSH and SFTP connections. This breaking change have some drawbacks though :
    
    * If you choose both SSH and SFTP roles on your servers then devices older than iOS 16 won't be able to show them. Workaround : choose only one role per server.
    * You can have many duplicates in the "All" list as both SSH and SFTP connections are now unified. I'm working on a migration tool to remove duplicates (contact me if you want to be a beta tester).

    Hey there :wave: I'm [isontheline](https://github.com/sponsors/isontheline) maintainer of WebSSH, the awesome iOS / macOS SSH, SFTP and Port Forwarding client that you use everyday!

    Whenever you need to make a [bug report](https://github.com/isontheline/pro.webssh.net/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=), or want to share an [idea](https://github.com/isontheline/pro.webssh.net/discussions?discussions_q=category%3AIdeas) for a new feature, or just have a [question](https://github.com/isontheline/pro.webssh.net/discussions?discussions_q=category%3AQ%26A) about how to use WebSSH, I'm never very far.

    You can contact me by [email](mailto:team@webssh.net), on [GitHub](https://github.com/isontheline/pro.webssh.net/discussions) or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/XfuJjhDJXQ) :satellite:

    Have a nice day :sunny:

!!! tip "Want to support me further?"
    WebSSH isn't a subscription based app (you buy it for [lifetime](/documentation/pricing/)) but if you like my work and want to support me further, you can become a [patron](https://en.liberapay.com/isontheline/) :construction_worker:, a [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/isontheline) :two_hearts: or you can [buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/isontheline) :coffee:

!!! bug "21 - Penguin :penguin:"
    If you encounter any catastrophic bug :bug:, it's time to submit a [bug report](https://github.com/isontheline/pro.webssh.net/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=) for the upcoming milestone.
    You can also learn about features [added / changed / removed](/documentation/changelog/21/) inside the next version of WebSSH.
    Of course you can [Enroll to Beta Releases](/documentation/becoming-external-tester/) in order to reach the stars :sparkles:

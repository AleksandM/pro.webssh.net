# Used Licenses
You will find in <a href="/licenses/" onclick="javascript:document.querySelector('label.md-header__button').click(); return false;">this directory</a> all third party softwares and their licenses used inside WebSSH. 

Without them WebSSH couldn't be the awesome SSH client you use everyday.

Thanks to them all.
